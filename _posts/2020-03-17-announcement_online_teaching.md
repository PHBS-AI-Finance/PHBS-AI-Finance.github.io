Hi, we will deliver lectures at campus tomorrow as usual. For those who will not be at the campus, please make sure you can take the quiz on time. Given the fact that many students will finish the remaining course online, we will host the lecture on Zoom tomorrow as a test.

We have decided not to change the structure of the assessments, so please make sure you can take the quiz at 10am UK time every Wednesday for the next few weeks no matter where your physical location is.

We will continuously measure the quality of delivering the course and make adjustments accordingly if needed. We will also follow the government and school guidances on COVID-19.

Wishing you all the best during this difficult time.
